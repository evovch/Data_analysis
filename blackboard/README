Both nXYTER and PADIWA are
5 kHz pulser/laser frequency, i.e. T=200000ns

Everythin is scaled by 1/5 (on top of the 1/5 scaling of the nXYTER data)
1) to compare with the old blackboard (fine!)
2) to normalize to 1 kHz

PADIWA ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

PADIWA data: threshold_scan_2

Event window size:
A 80ns (in fact everything falls into the 55ns window)
B 100000ns (40000ns-140000ns)

One file is 120 sec.
There are 600000 sync messages per TDC (in agreement)


nXYTER ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

nXYTER data: full_area_2
only 1 file used

nXYTER: 3000000 AUX messages
hence one file is 600 sec => scale by 1/5

Event window size:
A 70ns
B 100000ns (40000ns-140000ns)

But! I think that the "A" win size does not matter as the goal of this window is just
to take the peak which is concentrated in some limited range.
Increasing the size of this window does not really affect the amount of signal taken.
