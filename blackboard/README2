For the results set #2 another nXYTER input file is used:
full_area_data1_0000.root
Which corresponds to another run (different from the full_area_2) and has 1 kHz pulser frequency and lowest threshold.

No normalization is required here, because the pulser frequency is 1 kHz (and not 5 kHz in the other set of input data).
Plus the acquisition time is exactly the same - 120 sec, so, again, no extra normalization is needed.






PADIWA:
5 kHz pulser/laser frequency, i.e. T=200000ns

nXYTER:
1 kHz pulser/laser frequency, i.e. T=1000000ns

Only the PADIWA data is scaled by 1/5
1) to compare with the old blackboard (fine!)
2) to normalize to 1 kHz

PADIWA ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

PADIWA data: threshold_scan_2

Event window size:
A 80ns (in fact everything falls into the 55ns window)
B 100000ns (40000ns-140000ns)

One file is 120 sec.
There are 600000 sync messages per TDC (in agreement)


nXYTER ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

nXYTER data: full_area_1_0000
only 1 file used
1 kHz freq and lowest threshold

nXYTER: 120000 AUX messages
hence one file is 120 sec

Event window size:
A 100ns
B 100000ns (40000ns-140000ns)

But! I think that the "A" win size does not matter as the goal of this window is just
to take the peak which is concentrated in some limited range.
Increasing the size of this window does not really affect the amount of signal taken.
